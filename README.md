This paper proposes a novel Uncertainty Allocation-based Tube MPC (UA-TMPC) framework. Departing from conventional static policies, we introduce a cost-aware active uncertainty allocation mechanism that treats allocation coefficients as decision variables, thereby dynamically directing forecasting errors towards the most cost-effective flexible resources. To address the resulting mathematical challenges of decision-dependent uncertainty, we construct adaptive ambiguity tubes that proactively adjust their geometry based on the allocation strategy. Furthermore, a soft-constrained formulation is integrated to mitigate the conservatism of hard tube bounds, enhancing solution feasibility without compromising system reliability.
